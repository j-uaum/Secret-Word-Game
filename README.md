<h2>About the game</h2>
<p>This game was inspired by those old tv shows. It consists of the participant guessing the words letter by letter. If he hits the word, he can continue the game with a scoring system with 100 points per word correct.</p>
<p>If the participant misses the letters of the word, he will lose his 3 chances and must return to the beginning of the game</p>

<hr></hr>
<h2>About the development</h2>
<p>The system was made in 3 ways: "StartGame","Game","Over". It's these three stages that dictate the functioning and progress of the game. We didn't pay much attention to the style of the game, as the focus was on developing the system based on the concept. in this project, we 've been used some hooks, useState, useEffect and useCallback</p>
